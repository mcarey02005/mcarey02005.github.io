          Our first category is the actual causes of our issue.  We realized that some solutions could contribute to these causes and that landed those solutions under the causes category
          Next, we grouped together all ideas that involved securing peoples laundry by forcing people to verify their identity before touching any laundry.
          After that, we created a group that addresses the accuracy of detecing when a machine is done.  There are apps that already do this, but I can say from personal experience that they almost never work
          Next, we added a technology section.  This section has more broad ideas regarding how we can utilize technology to address our problem.
          Finally, we have a misc sectioen for solutions that were not entirely off the table, but did not fit well into existing categories.  This is also where we are keeping smaller misc concepts that can tie into previous categories.

          My storyboard shows a guy going to do his laundry, however all of the washing machines are being used or have clothing in them.  This makes him angry.  John ultimatley has to wait 30 minutes to start his laundry, and now he is running behind.
